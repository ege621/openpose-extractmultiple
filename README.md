# openpose-extractmultiple
This code extracts keypoints from multiple videos in a directory in sequence using subprocess.

Originally, openpose only allows you to extrasct keypoints from a single video, which makes huge amounts of data extraction a hassle, especially for deep learning applications where a lot of data is needed.

Please refer to the original openpose arguments documentation if the provided commands do not work for you, since the commands you pick depend on the hardware you use and the resolution of the videos you wish to process.
